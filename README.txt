This is a mini project that aims to build machine learning models to predict probability of default. 
Several base models are tried: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifer. 
Ensemble models are also used: Random Forest, Bagging, AdaBoost. 
This project contains an experiment to find the best strategy to deal with data with unbalanced target distribution.  
Models are evaluated with Area Under ROC curve. 

The data is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit
